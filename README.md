## Instructions for students:

### Create a ToDoList

-   The user should be able to add TODO items to a list using the input field.
    - The Input field should have the placeholder "Add a task"
    - The user should be able to add a task by clicking the "Add a Task" button
    - The items should be `li` elements
-   The user should be able to mark an item as completed
    - Each item should have a "Set to Done" button
    - Items should be striked through when they are completed. Add the class `.done` to the `li` element in order to achieve this.
-   The user should be able to delete an item
    - Each item should have a "Delete task" button
    - When the user clicks the button, the item should be removed from the list.

Note: You may want to use the `useState` hook to manage the state of the to-do list in the App.js file.

-   Here is an image for reference:
